## VineTS

A quick (ish) project to learn the basics of typescript, by mimicing an existing project from javascript, vinejs.  This allowed me to learn typescript and also to understand how to add a javascript library (the flower).

I intend to add jest tests, as an exercise.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
